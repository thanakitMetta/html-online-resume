                        A virtual robotic programming and image processing project for an interactive virtual
                        robot. The user may direct the robot to attain checkpoints. Each checkpoint will have
                        a mini-game utilizing a camera and image processing. This project is a team project
                        composed of 3 Thai students and 3 Japanese students. My role in this project is to
                        develop an image processing to capture hand movement form the webcam.
